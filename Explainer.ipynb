    "### **_About:_**\n",
    "This notebook contains a portfolio system which, given a universe of stocks and a maximum size of N different stocks, the top N performing stocks are chosen to make up the portfolio and weighted according to a market cap scheme. A TLH engine is integrated into this system of screening and weighting. The TLH engine itself handles a single stock at a time but the portfolio system uses a loop to apply the engine to every asset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Important Features & Points Of The Main Portfolio System:_**\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can of course buy and sell assets on your portfolio which will then track those trades and the individual quantities of the assets held on the portfolio. Also it's important to note that the system doesn't support short selling but does allow for consecutive buys or sells at different dates and prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The portfolio has a rebalancing capability as briefly mentioned above. First the top N stocks are screened and ranked using a monthly returns based system. Those N ranked stocks are then weighted using a market cap scheme, giving quantities to buy or sell for the N stocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Any portfolio you make or have made can be saved and loaded to keep track of progress and trades you have made.\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Important Features & Points Of The Tax-Loss Harvesting Engine:_**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Currently the engine doesn't accurately tax the gains using a simplified long and short term rate of 10% and 20% respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The engine starts by checking if the trades of the given stock violate the wash sale rule with a transaction of the stock within the past 30 days.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If the stock doesn't violate the wash sale rule, the engine proceeds to calculate the FIFO realised and unrealised gains and losses of that stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Next the engine calculates the tax due before and after a harvest of the given stock. If the percentage savings of tax are greater than a given threshold, the engine returns true to signal that the given stock should be harvested."
